# TZ zone descriptions

#
# From Paul Eggert (2013-08-14):
#
# This file contains a table where each row stands for an area that is
# the intersection of a region identified by a country code and of a
# zone where civil clocks have agreed since 1970.  The columns of the
# table are as follows:
#
# 1.  ISO 3166 2-character country code.  See the file 'iso3166.tab'.
# 2.  Latitude and longitude of the area's principal location
#     in ISO 6709 sign-degrees-minutes-seconds format,
#     either +-DDMM+-DDDMM or +-DDMMSS+-DDDMMSS,
#     first latitude (+ is north), then longitude (+ is east).
# 3.  Zone name used in value of TZ environment variable.
#     Please see the 'Theory' file for how zone names are chosen.
#     If multiple zones overlap a country, each has a row in the
#     table, with column 1 being duplicated.
# 4.  Comments; present if and only if the country has multiple rows.
#
# Columns are separated by a single tab.
# The table is sorted first by country, then an order within the country that
# (1) makes some geographical sense, and
# (2) puts the most populous areas first, where that does not contradict (1).
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#
# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select time
# zone data appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not intended
# to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.
